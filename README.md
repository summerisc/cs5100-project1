# cs5100-project1
This is a Cornell University CS5100 course project. We used D3.js libarary mainly and combined other related libraries of JS to develop a data visulization project. The data was collected from IMDB database and we want to pick up top 50 movies in each decade(based on ratings). Compare their qualities using ratings and their box offices.
